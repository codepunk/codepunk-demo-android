TODO NEXT:
On doubletap, first calculate what the "real" center will be so the animation is always smooth

Address all TODO synchronized
Only fling when fling enabled
Only scroll when scroll enabled
Only scale when pinch-to-zoom enabled
Test to see if image is at "baseline" before saving/restoring on config change

TODO VERSION6 :
TODO NEXT So close!
Edge effects
Make sure I'm checking all flags for scroll, fling, doubletap etc. and doing all synchronized where appropriate

Also I kind of want to clean up how I'm throwing around mImageMatrix, mNewImageMatrix, mMatrixValues, mSrcRect & mDstRect etc.

TODO What do I want to be private vs protected (or public) final?
TODO What about all this @NonNull final stuff?
x TODO Think about using pools for Matrix, RectF, float[] ?

---------

Next in this latest iteration:
x * Figure out why onScroll produces shaky results
x * Figure out why onScale sometimes shifts the image
x * Get onDoubleTapEvent to work (and remove clampTransform) <-- This works!!

x * When scrolling AND scaling, they fight each other. How to fix?

TODO !! Read http://i-rant.arnaudbos.com/matrices-for-developers/ (Matrices for Developers)

New TODO:

Bug: When zooming out and scale type is Fit Center or Fit End, goes down to 0, 0 instead
Bug: Saving transform info over orientation change no longer works
Add TransformInfo to mPoolManager?
Only fling when fling enabled
Only scroll when scroll enabled
Only scale when pinch-to-zoom enabled
Test to see if image is at "baseline" before saving/restoring on config change
