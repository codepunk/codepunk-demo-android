Bug: Controls fragment now shows NaN for scale

Take care of INVALID_FLAG_PIVOT_POINT
Calls to firstFinite always calculate the last one. Can I avoid?
Test to see if image is at "baseline" before saving/restoring on config change
 -- I can do this by using NaN for scaleX/scaleY?
Think about when to test for drawable has intrinsic size

Bug: If scaleType is centerCrop and you go from landscape to portrait, scale isn't adjusted correctly
Bug: When padding is not 0, coming up with wrong trans x/y when minimized in centerCrop (so,
     the constrainTransformInfo seems to be wrong) <-- Mostly top or left being too big, it seems?
