TODO NEXT:

Think about when to test for drawable has intrinsic size

Reconsider all of my null checks. Can I just allow crash? What does google do?

Replace all "releaseXYZ" methods in PoolManager with single generic

Tracking pools:
When creating, increase "number in use"
When I don't have to create, decrease "number stored"
When releasing increase "number stored" and decrease "number in use"

* Use sMatrix instead of matrix pool
* Test other pools for usage > 1 (like Options? Or just use a simple instance var and grab the fields immediately)

* The bug is back with image jumping after scale. Something about pivot point

* Bug - if you fling twice quickly to pan, you see 2 edge effects in succession
* Bug - sometimes at end of fling, image shifts
