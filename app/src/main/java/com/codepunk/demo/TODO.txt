TODO NEXT:

Think about when to test for drawable has intrinsic size

Reconsider all of my null checks. Can I just allow crash? What does google do?

Remove TODOs and revisit warnings

When pinch scaling, always send adjusted scale in case one direction gets clamped and the other doesn't

Add isTouchEvent to ImageViewInteractinator?

xxx 1. onScale
2. Transforminator
3. smoothTransform
4. onDoubleTapUp
5. EdgeEffects

Think about onSingleTapUp. If I don't set doubleTapEnabled, can I remove the listener from the GestureDetector?
(That way I'd get a quicker single tap event)

xxx Bug:
xxx If scaling, and then remove 1st finger but keep 2nd down, image jumps. What do I need to do?
