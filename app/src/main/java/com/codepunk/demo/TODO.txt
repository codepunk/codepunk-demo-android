Think about when to test for drawable has intrinsic size

Reconsider all of my null checks. Can I just allow crash? What does google do?

* Bug - if you fling twice quickly to pan, you see 2 edge effects in succession. Probably because
  one ended before fling is finished

  It seems to have something to do with -- if it was EVER not finished during a fling, then don't
  absorb it again if it shows up as finished again.

  So --
  in onFling, set a mEdgeEffectLeftRan flag to false
  in computeScroll, check mEdgeEffectLeft.isFinished. If false, set mEdgeEffectLeftRan to true.
  ELSE, call mEdgeEffectLeft onAbsorb only if mEdgeEffectLeftRan is false.

  - OR - can I use the active flags?
  onFling: releaseEdgeEffects but DON'T reset active flags
  computeScroll: if isFinished, THEN reset active flag. Otherwise, ??


* Bug - sometimes at end of fling, image shifts
