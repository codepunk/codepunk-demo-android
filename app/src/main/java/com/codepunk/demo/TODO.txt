TODO NEXT:

Take care of INVALID_FLAG_PIVOT_POINT
Think about when to test for drawable has intrinsic size

Bug: When padding is not 0, coming up with wrong trans x/y when minimized in centerCrop (so,
     the constrainTransformInfo seems to be wrong) <-- Mostly top or left being too big, it seems?


Reconsider all of my null checks. Can I just allow crash? What does google do?
