TODO NEXT:
Address all TODO synchronized
Only fling when fling enabled
Only scroll when scroll enabled
Only scale when pinch-to-zoom enabled
Test to see if image is at "baseline" before saving/restoring on config change

In InteractiveImageView:
Clean up setLayoutInternal, combine with onScroll etc.

In InteractiveImageViewControlsFragment:
Save/restore state of scale, center, etc. <-- looking good for now
Research: Does ImageView remember Matrix values after configuration change?

TODO:
Edge Effects !!
Double-tap to zoom
Play with cropToPadding, see how it behaves. (Like "viewport" in my original concept?)
