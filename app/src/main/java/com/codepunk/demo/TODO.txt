TODO NEXT:

Think about when to test for drawable has intrinsic size

Reconsider all of my null checks. Can I just allow crash? What does google do?

* The bug is back with image jumping after scale. Something about pivot point

* Bug - if you fling twice quickly to pan, you see 2 edge effects in succession. Probably because
  one ended before fling is finished
* Bug - sometimes at end of fling, image shifts
