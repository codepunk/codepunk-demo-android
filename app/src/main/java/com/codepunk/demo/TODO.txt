TODO NEXT:

Think about when to test for drawable has intrinsic size

Reconsider all of my null checks. Can I just allow crash? What does google do?

Remove TODOs and revisit warnings

When pinch scaling, always send adjusted scale in case one direction gets clamped and the other doesn't

Add isTouchEvent to ImageViewInteractinator?
xxx 1. onScale
xxx 2. Transforminator
xxx 3. smoothTransform
xxx 4. onDoubleTap
5. EdgeEffects

Pull resolve/clamp out of private version of transform?
all public versions would have to
