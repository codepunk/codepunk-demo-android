TODO NEXT:
DEFINITELY Need to check if edge effects != null
Only fling when fling enabled
Only scroll when scroll enabled
Only scale when pinch-to-zoom enabled
Test to see if image is at "baseline" before saving/restoring on config change
Think about when to test for drawable has intrinsic size

xxx Bug: When Y can't scroll and you fling X, sometimes you still see Y edge effects
xxx Bug: Saving transform info over orientation change no longer works
Bug: If scaleType is centerCrop and you go from landscape to portrait, scale isn't adjusted correctly
Bug: onScroll still sometimes clashes with onScale when pinching down far -- jerkiness etc.
Bug: When switching from one image to another, need to reset matrix?
Bug: When padding is not 0, coming up with wrong trans x/y when minimized in centerCrop (so,
     the constrainTransformInfo seems to be wrong) <-- Mostly top or left being too big, it seems?

xxx TODO:
xxx Change to these methods
