TODO NEXT:
Catch when scrolling image view and we hit drawer. Drawer intercepts touch. Messes with alpha etc.

In InteractiveImageView:
Clean up setLayoutInternal, combine with onScroll etc.

In InteractiveImageViewControlsFragment:
Save/restore state of scale, center, etc.
Research: Does ImageView remember Matrix values after configuration change?

TODO:
Edge Effects !!
Play with cropToPadding, see how it behaves. (Like "viewport" in my original concept?)
